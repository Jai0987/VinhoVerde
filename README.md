# Determining Vinho Verde Wine Quality Prediction using Ensemble learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the quality of Portuguese Vinho Verde wine based on various chemical attributes. Using an **ExtraTreesClassifier** and **SMOTE** for handling class imbalances, the model achieves an **accuracy of 89.02%** on the test set.
The dataset used contains chemical features for both red and white wines, and the quality score is a crucial feature that ranges from 0 to 10.
